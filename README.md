# Ascend by Partnerize GTM Community Template
Ascend by Partnerize is a performance marketing solutions provider powering growth for marketers seeking a scaled alternative to their primary sales and marketing channels. The Ascend by Partnerize community template places two Pepperjam tags on your website to track publisher parter traffic and conversions: Ascend by Partnerize's Container Tag on every page and our dynamic conversion pixel on the confirmation page.
